# drcom-py
This is a Drcom Web Authentication login program written in Python. The program can only be guaranteed to run among Shenzhen University students who use 'SZU_WLAN' or campus cable network. There are several simple settings can be configured and more will be added to make the program flexible. Generally you should download and install *[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)* and *[requests(Python package)](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests)* first, while Embedded version uses *urllib(Python3)* or *urllib,urllib2(Python2)* instead of *requests* to post data. *Tkinter* might also needed to be manually installed if you need *drcom-gui*. Embedded version also removes some extended function.

## Known Issues
### Python path incorrect
Manually change the path in drcom.py before you install it.

### Run under Mac OS
Apple has introduced [new security policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection) since OS X El Capitan which forbid even root users to write /usr/bin. You might turn it off to use drcom-py but it's not officially recommended.

### Run under Windows OS
You might need to Google yourself to make it run in command line in Windows before official release :-(
